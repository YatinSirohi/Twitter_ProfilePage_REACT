# Twitter_ProfilePage_REACT
This is a small project where I created Twitter clone - Profile page, using React.
React, Bootstrap and css are used in the project and mongo db is used a database. (Database access is open to all)
Server.js has the code of setting up mongodb.
Node modules need to be installed to run the app.
To run, navigate to ../src and enter command node server.js. This will connect the app to the server. (server runs on 3001 port)
Then enter command, npm start which will run the application on 3000 port number.
This project is only to demonstrate my understanding in react, bootstrap and css.
